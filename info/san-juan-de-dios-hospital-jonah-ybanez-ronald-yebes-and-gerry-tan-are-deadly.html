that the developer of this application is one of the victims of San Juan de Diablo este Dios <i>(SJDEFI)</i> Hospital <i>(pasay, philippines)</i> where negligences and malpractices are at their finest and is being tolerated by authorities, WISELY investigate and compare it to other countries if you doubt.</p><p>SJDEFI-Hospital, specially their general ultrasound, unknowledgeable staffs like their radiologic technologist Jonah B. Yba√±ez, multi-tasking radiologist Ronald G. Yebes, their deceitful cardiologist Gerry C. Tan and their stupid management are all frauds, deceivers, dangerous and causing wrongful death.</p><p>My misery starts on their wrongful whole abdomen ultrasound procedure, followed up by their consistent cover ups that completely buried the botched procedure, ended up to harmful and deadly medications prescribed by their idiot and careless cardiology.</p><ul><li><p>Their radiologic technologist Jonah B. Yba√±ez is having no knowledge on anything, nor on what she&#x27;s seeing on their ultrasound monitor.</p><ul><li><p>I was on their general ultrasound service early in the morning, already fasted 8 hours, when she required me to pee no more, then I waited for about an hour.</p></li><li><p>After the first scan, she requires me to eat and drink a lot of water without urinating and go back if I really need to pee.</p><ul><li><p>After eating, drinking 500mL of water and going back, a little bit of holding my pee, she asked me to drink another 500mL FOR A TOTAL OF 1 LITER. She seems in rush and prioritizing the radiologist which went somewhere. They want, when they scan, that&#x27;s it!</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A couple of time I ask them that I&#x27;m peeing, a couple of time her co-workers call her, she&#x27;s just pointing to the old patient laying in a hospital bed even there&#x27;s still a vacant ultrasound table.</p><ul><li><p>A male patient <i>(or he might be a watcher)</i> shouts telling <i>&quot;Hey, could you look after him? It&#x27;s been a while, what if something happens to him?&quot;</i> That took their attention.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>I thought that the following scan would just take a few seconds based on what I&#x27;m hearing.</p><ul><li><p>While she&#x27;s scanning me, she might even don&#x27;t know that my urine has already flowed backward into my kidneys.</p></li><li><p>After her turn, another bullshit: she still called the radiologist which went somewhere and it takes another minutes making me cry asking to cancel the procedure, no present staff came even they&#x27;re there! Their procedure really makes me hold my 1 liter-drunk pee for that long THAT YOU COULD NEVER IMAGINE.</p></li></ul></li></ul><img title="SJDEFI-Hospital radiographer-jonah-ybanez" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/540wEXFNVUpYHIPKKhs1Sr/37007a0d5d5c5ac3ad7e86a5e40a8f95/SJDEFI-Hospital_radiographer-jonah-ybanez.png" class="jsx-3061564172"/></li><li><p>Their radiologist Ronald G.

Her face tells that something wasn&#x27;t right, she asks me <i>&quot;Did you urinate them all?&quot;</i> I replied <i>&quot;Not all came out, maybe later.&quot;</i> Then she asked the radiologist if he needed to check me again, the doctor declined.

A different radiologist checked and asked me <i>&quot;I guess you mostly eat meat?&quot;</i> which is not. The next process was suspiciously different: They ask me to just sit and drink there. The clerk receptionist answered me to just drink the amount of water that I can, we waited there for a couple of seconds, they tried to scan me again but my gallbladder is still not full, then they allow me to leave and come back when I&#x27;m peeing.</p><p>I still saw some patients that were holding their urine for too long.

The 2nd was a woman running to their comfort room in panic after her turn.</p><p>When I came back holding my urine, still the same, I still came back a couple of times but not as many as I&#x27;m now sharply complaining <i>(don&#x27;t really want to happen again what happened on my previous ultrasound)</i>.
