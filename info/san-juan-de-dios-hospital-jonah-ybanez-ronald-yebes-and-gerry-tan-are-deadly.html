radiologic technologist jonah b. yba√±ez, multi-tasking radiologist ronald g. yebes, concealing management/admin and their rude-prescribing cardiologist gerry c. tan are frauds and dangerous causing deceitful wrongful death.</p><p>My health started to have a lower left abdominal issue after their idiotic whole abdomen ultrasound procedure when taking pain reliever, followed up by their consistent

This backward flow, called reflux, may damage or scar the kidneys. - NIDDK</p></blockquote></li><li><p>After her turn, another bullshit: she still called the radiologist which went somewhere and it took further minutes making me cry asking to cancel the procedure, no present staff came even they&#x27;re there!

Such fraudulence..</p><blockquote><p>It&#x27;s not a dispute between people, they&#x27;re actually fooling others. It seems their victims are the one who does evil. If there&#x27;s just little empathy left from them, from the beginning, they&#x27;ll start figuring out any possible damage their malpractices could make. Or just tell their harms for early treatments, or offer a free procedure if the previous is harmful, instead of keep trying performing magic whenever they&#x27;ve got an error. Other criminals would cooperate, those fraudsters aren&#x27;t, unless you&#x27;re wise enough to catch them telling lies. They don&#x27;t care about their patients, look at their procedures and stupidities.</p></blockquote><p>They should&#x27;ve greater consequences, the more hard their deadly fraudulence gets caught.</p><blockquote><p>Even if authorities knew that some de diablo workers are stupids and just malpracticing, they&#x27;ll still do nothing until another innocent gets victimized. Some didn&#x27;t like any thread or lesson for that terrible hospital <i>(I hope one day those authorities will get what they deserve)</i>, like an officer alluding: asking his buddy where is his chain, up to the point that some is touching their undrawn gun in front of me.</p><p>I don&#x27;t know if their brains are on the opposite side or what? In non-unmannerly environmental countries, it&#x27;s disgracefully unacceptable, they would have caught those who just doing horrible works, especially the idiotic ultrasound procedure staff and the erroneously prescribing granny even before they could harm somebody.
