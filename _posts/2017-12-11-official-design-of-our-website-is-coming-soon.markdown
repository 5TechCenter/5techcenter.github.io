The developer of this site is planning to use React *(JavaScript library)* to build its user interface.
We will design views with React.js because of its flexibility and efficiency to update and render the right components for our pages.

For the meantime, we are using Jekyll *(software)* to generate our static website. It will become a React application as soon as we are ready to deploy the official design of our website.
